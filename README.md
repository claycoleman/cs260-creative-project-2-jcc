For this lab, you will create a website that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This website can be for anything you want, but should not be similar to Lab 2.

Your main goal with this project is to connect to an API using JavaScript, like what we did with Lab 2. You should find an open API (e.g. free, but perhaps requires registration), and write a site that uses this API to present the data.

You should look at this list of open APIs https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis

Requirements
This is a creative project, so you are welcome to build what you would like. The basic requirements are:

- [x] The site uses JavaScript and fetch to get data from an external API
- [x] The site contains a footer that links to your public GitHub repository
- [x] The GitHub repository should be in your own GitHub account.

Submission
Please submit to Canvas the URL for your web server, where your code is running (e.g. on your DigitalOcean server). On this website, in a footer, you must include a link to your GitHub repository. Use a unique URL for the project, e.g. cp2.emmasmith.org.

Rubric for Grading
We will grade your projects based on:

how clearly you present the data from the API
how well you follow web design principles: spacing, typography, color, consistency, and responsive design.
TAs will assign scores in these ranges:

90-100: Excellent presentation of data from the API, clearly follows web design principles
80-90: Uses an external API, good effort was made, but needs work to more clearly present the data or follow web design principles
70-80: Fulfills the minimum requirement of using an API, but does not make a strong effort to present the data clearly or follow web design principles
